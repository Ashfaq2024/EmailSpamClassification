The goal of this project is to classify email messages as either spam or legitimate using 
machine learning algorithms. The classification will be based on specific features 
extracted from the email content, such as the frequency of capitalized words and their 
sequence patterns. This project aims to build a model that can distinguish between spam 
and legitimate emails, which can be used in a variety of email filtering applications.# EmailSpamClassification
